# HexDocs MCP Server

A TypeScript server implementing the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that provides semantic search capabilities for Hex package documentation. It's designed to work seamlessly with embeddings generated by the [hexdocs_mcp](https://github.com/bradleygolden/hexdocs_mcp) Elixir package, making Hex documentation easily searchable in AI applications.

## Features

- MCP-compatible server for searching Hex package documentation
- Integrates with embeddings generated by the [hexdocs_mcp](https://github.com/bradleygolden/hexdocs_mcp) Elixir package
- Built on the Model Context Protocol standard for compatibility with AI tools
- Easy installation via `npx` for quick setup
- Simple configuration with customizable database paths

## Requirements

- Node.js 18 or later
- Access to a `hexdocs_mcp` generated SQLite database (requires running `mix hex.docs.mcp fetch PACKAGE` on the desired packages first)

## Installation

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g hexdocs_mcp_server

# Or install in your project
npm install hexdocs_mcp_server
```

## Configuration

The server looks for the SQLite database created by the `hexdocs_mcp` package. By default, it uses `~/.hexdocs_mcp/hexdocs_mcp.db`, but you can specify a custom path:

```bash
# Example: Set custom database path
export HEXDOCS_MCP_PATH=/path/to/custom/directory
```

## Usage

```bash
# Start the server
npx hexdocs-mcp-server

# Specify custom database path
npx hexdocs-mcp-server --db-path=/path/to/db

# Search from CLI
npx hexdocs-mcp-server search "how to use channels" phoenix

# List available packages
npx hexdocs-mcp-server list-packages
```

## Integration

The server can be integrated with various AI tools that support the Model Context Protocol. Here's an example for Cursor:

Add this to your `mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hexdocs-mcp-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["hexdocs-mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Pro Tip

You can use the `hexdocs_mcp_server` library within your AI tooling to programmatically generate commands for adding packages using `mix hex.docs.mcp` so you don't have to manually. For example, an AI might find that you don't have the documentation for a given tool and then recognize it can run `mix hex.docs.mcp fetch ...`.
